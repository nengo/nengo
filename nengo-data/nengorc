### NENGORC FORMAT

# Nengo RC settings will be read from the following files.
# Files listed first have higher precedence.
#
# 1. nengorc in the current directory.
#    This is useful for settings specific to a single project.
# 2. A operating system specific file in the user's home directory.
#    - Windows: %userprofile%\nengo\nengorc
#    - Other (OS X, Linux): ~/.config/nengo/nengorc
# 3. INSTALL/nengo-data/nengorc (where INSTALL is the installation directory
#    of the Nengo package; this is usually something like
#    /usr/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages or C:\PythonXX\Lib\site-packages).
#
# This example file lists the settings supported by core Nengo with
# a description, the accepted data type and an example line setting the option
# to its default value (commented out).
#
# The RC file is divided into sections by lines containing the section name
# in square brackets. Blanks lines, or lines starting with # or, are ignored,
# as are trailing comments. A setting is set by giving the name followed by
# a : or = and the value.
#
# [example_section]
# setting = value  # optional comment

### CONFIGURATION BEGINS HERE

# --- Settings for controlling the precision of all calculations
[precision]

# Default bit precision for all NumPy arrays made by Nengo (e.g., bits: 64
# would use float64/int64 dtypes). Must be one of '16', '32', or '64'. (string)
#bits: 64

# --- Settings for the decoder cache
[decoder_cache]

# Enable or disable the cache. (bool)
#enabled = True

# Path where the cached decoders will be stored. (str)
#path = ~/.cache/nengo/decoders  # Linux/Mac OS X default

# Set the cache to readonly. In readonly mode cached decoders will be
# loaded, but no newly calculated decoders will be written to the cache.
# (bool)
#readonly = False

# Set the maximum cache size. Whenever the cache exceeds this limit, cached
# decoders will be deleted, beginning with the oldest, until the limit
# is met again. Please specify the unit (e.g., 512 MB). (str)
#size = 512 MB


# --- Settings for error messages due to exceptions
[exceptions]

# Use simplified exceptions. In most cases, simplified exceptions will be
# easier to read and more useful for model development. However,
# developers of Nengo internals or tools extending Nengo
# may benefit from full exception tracebacks.
#simplified = True


# --- Settings for the progress bar used when running the simulator
[progress]

# Set the progress bar to use. The default of 'auto' or will display
# a progress bar when the estimated simulation run time exceeds one second.
# Setting this to 'none' will disable to progress bar. Any other string
# will be interpreted as a module and class name
# (e.g., 'nengo.utils.progress.ProgressBar'), which Nengo will attempt
# to load. (str)
#progress_bar = auto


# --- Settings for the Nengo core simulator
[nengo.Simulator]

# Fail misconfigured operators immediately. If True, operators are tested
# when they are created in build functions, rather than when they are
# initialized by the simulator. Failing fast is useful when creating and
# debugging new operators, but adds some time to the build.
#fail_fast = False
