Contributor Assignment Agreement

Harmony (HA-CAA-I-ANY) Version 1.0

Nengo Individual Contributor Assignment Agreement
=================================================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nengo ("We" or "Us").
This contributor agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted
by contributors to Us. To make this document effective, please sign it
and send it to Us by electronic submission, following the instructions
at
<https://github.com/ctn-waterloo/nengo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.rst>.
This is a legally binding document, so please read it carefully before
agreeing to it. The Agreement may cover more than one software project
managed by Us.

1. Definitions
--------------

"You" means the individual who Submits a Contribution to Us.

"Contribution" means any work of authorship that is Submitted by You
to Us in which You own or assert ownership of the Copyright. If You do
not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship, please follow
the instructions in
<https://github.com/ctn-waterloo/nengo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.rst>.

"Copyright" means all rights protecting works of authorship owned or
controlled by You, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights,
as appropriate, for the full term of their existence including any
extensions by You.

"Material" means the work of authorship which is made available by Us
to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software
project, the Material means the work of authorship to which the
Contribution was Submitted. After You Submit the Contribution, it may
be included in the Material.

"Submit" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
communication sent to Us or our representatives, including but not
limited to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for
the purpose of discussing and improving the Material, but excluding
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

"Submission Date" means the date on which You Submit a Contribution to
Us.

"Effective Date" means the date You execute this Agreement or the date
You first Submit a Contribution to Us, whichever is earlier.

2. Grant of Rights
------------------

2.1 Copyright Assignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(a) At the time the Contribution is Submitted, You assign to Us all
    right, title, and interest worldwide in all Copyright covering the
    Contribution; provided that this transfer is conditioned upon
    compliance with Section 2.3.

(b) To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) cannot be
    assigned by You to Us, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
    exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license under
    such non-assigned rights, with rights to sublicense through
    multiple tiers of sublicensees, to practice such non-assigned
    rights, including, but not limited to, the right to reproduce,
    modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution; provided
    that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

(c) To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) can neither
    be assigned nor licensed by You to Us, You irrevocably waive and
    agree never to assert such rights against Us, any of our
    successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or
    indirect; provided that this agreement not to assert is
    conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

(d) Upon such transfer of rights to Us, to the maximum extent
    possible, We immediately grant to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license
    under such rights covering the Contribution, with rights to
    sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce,
    modify, display, perform, and distribute the Contribution. The
    intention of the parties is that this license will be as broad as
    possible and to provide You with rights as similar as possible to
    the owner of the rights that You transferred. This license back is
    limited to the Contribution and does not provide any rights to the
    Material.

2.2 Patent License
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and
apparatus claims which You own, control or have the right to grant,
now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license,
with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of
sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import
and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in
combination with the Material (and portions of such combination). This
license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the
licensed rights infringes such patent claims; and provided that this
license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

2.3 Outbound License
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Based on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, if We include
Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under
any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or
proprietary licenses. As a condition on the exercise of this right, We
agree to also license the Contribution under the terms of the license
or licenses which We are using for the Material on the Submission
Date.

2.4 Moral Rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights
against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees,
either direct or indirect.

2.5 Our Rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as
part of the Material and may decide to include any Contribution We
consider appropriate.

2.6 Reservation of Rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any rights not expressly assigned or licensed under this section are
expressly reserved by You.

3. Agreement
------------

You confirm that:

(a) You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement.

(b) You own the Copyright and patent claims covering the Contribution
    which are required to grant the rights under Section 2.

(c) The grant of rights under Section 2 does not violate any grant of
    rights which You have made to third parties, including Your
    employer. If You are an employee, You have had Your employer
    approve this Agreement or sign the Entity version of this
    document. If You are less than eighteen years old, please have
    Your parents or guardian sign the Agreement.

(d) You have followed the instructions in
    <https://github.com/ctn-waterloo/nengo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.rst>,
    if You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship
    Submitted.

4. Disclaimer
-------------

EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 3, THE CONTRIBUTION IS
PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT
THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS
LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

5. Consequential Damage Waiver
------------------------------

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
YOU OR US BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED
SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE
LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE
CLAIM IS BASED.

6. Miscellaneous
----------------

**6.1** This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of Applied Brain Research Inc. excluding its conflicts
of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in
this section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("UN Convention") and
the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to
this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention
in its entirety to this Agreement.

**6.2** This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and
Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or
understandings.

**6.3** If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through
this Agreement to a third party, as a condition of the assignment,
that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and
obligations in the Agreement.

**6.4** The failure of either party to require performance by the
other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall
not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any
time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one
situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the
provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.

**6.5** If any provision of this Agreement is found void and
unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible
with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original
provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential
purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent
possible under law.
