Nengo is a Python library for building and simulating
large-scale neural models.
Nengo can create sophisticated
spiking and non-spiking neural simulations
with sensible defaults in a few lines of code.
Yet, Nengo is highly extensible and flexible.
You can define your own neuron types and learning rules,
get input directly from hardware,
build and run deep neural networks,
drive robots, and even simulate your model
on a completely different neural simulator
or neuromorphic hardware.

Installation
============

Nengo depends on NumPy, and we recommend that you
install NumPy before installing Nengo.
If you're not sure how to do this, we recommend using
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_.

To install Nengo::

    pip install nengo

If you have difficulty installing Nengo or NumPy,
please read the more detailed
`Nengo installation instructions
<https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/getting_started.html#installation>`_ first.

If you'd like to install Nengo from source,
please read the `developer installation instructions
<https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/contributing.html#developer-installation>`_.

Nengo is tested to work on Python 3.6 and above.
Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 were supported up to and including Nengo 2.8.0.
Python 3.5 was supported up to and including Nengo 3.1.

Examples
========

Here are six of
`many examples <https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples.html>`_
showing how Nengo enables the creation and simulation of
large-scale neural models in few lines of code.

1. `100 LIF neurons representing a sine wave
   <https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples/basic/many_neurons.html>`_
2. `Computing the square across a neural connection
   <https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples/basic/squaring.html>`_
3. `Controlled oscillatory dynamics with a recurrent connection
