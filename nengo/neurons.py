    This implementation is based on the original paper [1]_;

    What was originally 'v' we term 'voltage', which represents the membrane
    potential of each neuron. What was originally 'u' we term 'recovery',
    which represents membrane recovery, "which accounts for the activation
    of K+ ionic currents and inactivation of Na+ ionic currents."
    The 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' parameters are also renamed
    (see the parameters below).

    We use default values that correspond to regular spiking ('RS') neurons.
    For other classes of neurons, set the parameters as follows.

    * Intrinsically bursting (IB): ``reset_voltage=-55, reset_recovery=4``
    * Chattering (CH): ``reset_voltage=-50, reset_recovery=2``
    * Fast spiking (FS): ``tau_recovery=0.1``
    * Low-threshold spiking (LTS): ``coupling=0.25``

        fluctuations of voltage.
    reset_voltage : float, optional
        (Originally 'c') The voltage to reset to after a spike, in millivolts.

        amplitude of the output spikes of the neuron.
    initial_state : {str: Distribution or array_like}
        Mapping from state variables names to their desired initial value.
        These values will override the defaults set in the class's state attribute.
